This is a repo of scripts that I have written for manipulating primary sequence and secondary structure information.  
  
The initial consolidation of these scripts into this package is targeted towards generating libraries for mutate-rescue functional experiments.  
  
The long-term hope is to make this a general swiss-army-knife package that can easily be installed and used for RNA informatics.  
  
  
## TODOs:  
- Flesh out OOP for SeqStruct class 
- Add scripts for changing sequences for Mutate-Rescue experiments
- Add scripts for generating mutate-rescue libraries
- Add SLAP-seq enrichment data analysis and visualization
