# VERTOX

This is a repo of scripts that I have written for manipulating primary sequence and secondary structure information.

The initial consolidation of these scripts into this package is targeted towards generating libraries for mutate-rescue functional experiments.

The long-term hope is to make this a general swiss-army-knife package that can easily be installed and used for RNA informatics.
